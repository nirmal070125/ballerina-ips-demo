The user requires an HTTP service that responds with a FHIR IPS (International Patient Summary) data bundle when querying the endpoint /patient/{id}/$summary. The implementation should first query an external API defined in mpi_openapi.yaml to find the list of hospitals and patient IDs for a given unique patient ID in the request path. Then, it should search the hospital registry defined in hospitals_registry_openapi.yaml to find the hospital URLs. Finally, it should call the respective hospital APIs to retrieve the FHIR resources for Patient, Allergies, and Conditions. The user now needs test cases for this service.
