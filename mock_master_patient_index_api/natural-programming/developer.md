The service should return a list of patient IDs and hospital IDs combinations for a given unique patient ID using an in-memory data structure. The unique patient ID is distinct from hospital-specific patient IDs and is unique across multiple hospitals. For each unique patient ID, the service should return a map of hospital ID and patient ID combinations. Test cases should be added to test the service. The response of the service should be an array of mappings without including any additional elements. The service should return correct HTTP status codes for errors. The resource function should be isolated.
